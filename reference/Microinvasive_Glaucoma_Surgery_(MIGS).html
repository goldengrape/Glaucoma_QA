<meta name="description" content="Glaucoma is a disease affecting an estimated 60.5 million people worldwide and 5.7 million people in the United States as of 2010.&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&amp;#160; Globally, it accounts for 8% of all cases of blindness and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&amp;#160; In the United States, it accounts for an approximate annual cost of $1.5 billion.&amp;#91;3&amp;#93;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;Initial therapy for glaucoma typically consists of topical eye drops or laser trabeculoplasty, both of which aim to lower intraocular pressure and have similar efficacy.&amp;#91;4&amp;#93;&amp;#160;Historically though, when pharmacologic and/or laser treatment fails to control IOP, incisional surgery such as trabeculectomy or glaucoma drainage device implantation is required.&amp;#160; Despite their efficacy, these surgical interventions result in labile postoperative IOPs, require frequent follow-up, prolonged recovery time and offer a risk of serious early and late complications. Therefore, these procedures are often delayed in mild to moderate disease and reserved for patients with more severe disease who warrant aggressive intervention. For decades, this left clinicians and patients with a treatment gap of limited options for patients with mild to moderate disease who had uncontrolled IOP despite medical and laser therapy.&amp;#160; Even in patients who respond to medical therapy, there are several barriers to adequate therapy that may limit their long term utility.&amp;#160; These barriers include noncompliance with the prescribed regimen, intolerance of medication side effects, financial burden limiting access to medications, or physical inability to reliably self-administer eye drops.&amp;#91;5&amp;#93;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;However, in the last two decades the field of glaucoma has seen the advent of micro invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) which has sought to fulfill the unmet need for improved treatment options and close this treatment gap.&amp;#160;"/>

Therefore, these procedures are often delayed in mild to moderate disease and reserved for patients with more severe disease who warrant aggressive intervention. For decades, this left clinicians and patients with a treatment gap of limited options for patients with mild to moderate disease who had uncontrolled IOP despite medical and laser therapy.&#160; Even in patients who respond to medical therapy, there are several barriers to adequate therapy that may limit their long term utility.&#160; These barriers include noncompliance with the prescribed regimen, intolerance of medication side effects, financial burden limiting access to medications, or physical inability to reliably self-administer eye drops.<sup id="cite_ref-okeke5_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-okeke5-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>&#160; &#160;However, in the last two decades the field of glaucoma has seen the advent of micro invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) which has sought to fulfill the unmet need for improved treatment options and close this treatment gap.&#160;
</p><p>Patients generally are good candidates for MIGS if they have mild to moderate glaucoma, are intolerant or noncompliant with drops, or if their IOP is not controlled with topical eye drops or laser trabeculoplasty.&#160; MIGS procedures can also be used to reduce drop dependence at the time of traditional phacoemulsification surgery in patients whose disease may be well controlled.&#160; MIGS are often not sufficient treatment for patients with more advanced disease who require a low IOP goal.&#160; For these patient, traditional incisional surgeries such as glaucoma drainage implants or trabeculectomy are often still indicated.&#160;&#160; 
</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="MIGS_Definition">MIGS Definition</span></h1>
<p>MIGS procedures constitute a group of surgical interventions which share five characteristics<sup id="cite_ref-saheb5_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-saheb5-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>:
</p>
<ol><li>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>High safety profile</i>: MIGS carry a much lower risk of serious complications such as hypotony, choroidal effusions, or choroidal hemorrhages.&#160;</li>
<li>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Minimal disruption of normal anatomy</i>: MIGS allow for enhancement of physiological outflow mechanisms avoiding major alterations in normal ocular anatomy.</li>
<li>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Ab interno approach</i>: MIGS are typically performed <i>ab interno</i> through a traditional clear corneal wound with direct visualization of the anatomical target.&#160;</li>
<li>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Efficacy: </i>MIGS should offer meaningful IOP lowering effect. The level of IOP reduction is often inferior to traditional filtering surgery but should be at least 20%.&#160; Alternatively, patients who do not experience an IOP decrease should attain the reduction of at least one medication.</li>
<li>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Ease of use for patients and physicians: </i>MIGS should allow for a rapid recovery with minimal additional downtime for patients.&#160; They should also be easily incorporated into traditional phacoemulsification surgery.&#160;</li></ol>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="MIGS_Approaches">MIGS Approaches&#160;</span></h1>
<p>MIGS offer IOP lowering by targeting various aspects of normal aqueous dynamics.&#160; The first approaches involve enhancing outflow across the trabecular meshwork and through Schlemm’s canal.&#160; The juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork has traditionally been identified as the site of greatest resistance to aqueous outflow.&#160; This resistance can be overcome through bypassing or removing this tissue to lower IOP through increased outflow. Bypass can be achieved by placing a trabecular meshwork bypass stent which allows aqueous to flow directly through the stent from the anterior chamber into Schlemm’s canal.&#160; Another approach to bypass the resistance of the trabecular meshwork is goniotomy or trabeculotomy which involves surgical incision and/or excision of this tissue and allows for improved aqueous outflow into Schlemm’s canal. Dilation of Schlemm’s canal through cannulation and expansion with viscoelastic is yet another approach to improve outflow through the normal physiologic aqueous outflow system.&#160; 
</p><p>A second group of MIGS approaches seeks to increase outflow via alternate pathways.&#160; The uveoscleral outflow pathway can be augmented by accessing the suprachoroidal space with microstent placement.&#160; Alternatively, if traditional outflow pathways are unlikely to be improved, aqueous can be shunted into the subconjunctival space through an ab interno, small incision approach. 
</p><p>A third MIGS approach involves decreasing aqueous production by ablation of the ciliary body.&#160; This approach is employed during endocyclophotocoagulation in which an endoscopic laser probe is inserted through a clear corneal incision and used to directly visualize and ablate the ciliary body.&#160;

The system works by removing a strip of trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm’s canal in order to create a path for the drainage of aqueous humor.<sup id="cite_ref-brian7_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-brian7-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>&#160;The device consists of a single-use, disposable hand piece that performs electrocautery, irrigation, and aspiration. It is connected to a generator with a frequency of&#160;550 kHz&#160;that allows adjustments in 0.1 Watt increments and is controlled via a 3-stage foot pedal control that initiates irrigation, aspiration and electrocautery in sequence. Continuous irrigation and aspiration allows for removal of debris and regulation of temperature. Additionally, the tip of the Trabectome is bent at a 90° angle to create a protective triangular footplate and allow for easier insertion into Schlemm’s canal and is coated to facilitate smooth movement within the canal.

<p><b>Surgical approach</b>
</p><p>GATT is a form of <i>ab</i> <i>interno</i> trabeculotomy which was initially described by Grover <i>et al.</i> in 2014. Under direct visualization with a gonioscopy lens, a goniotomy is made in the nasal trabecular meshwork which serves as the entry point for the iTrack microcatheter (Ellex iScience, Fremont, CA).&#160; The microcatheter is 250 microns in diameter and has an illuminated distal tip to allow for visualization during advancement of the catheter through Schlemm’s canal.&#160; A modified technique has also been described using 4-0 nylon suture instead of the microcatheter. Microsurgical forceps are used to advance the microcatheter or suture into Schlemm canal circumferentially 360 degrees. Once it has been passed through the entire canal, the distal end of the catheter is grasped and the proximal end is retracted out of the eye, shearing the trabecular meshwork to create a 360-degree trabeculotomy.

<p><b>Device Design</b>
</p><p>The TRAB 360 system (Sight Sciences, Menlo Park, California) is a single-use hand piece that allows the surgeon to perform trabeculotomy through a clear corneal incision. &#160;&#160;The tip of the hand piece is used to pierce the trabecular meshwork and the microcatheter is advanced from the tip of the device and threaded through 180 degrees of Schlemm’s canal.&#160; With the microcatheter still in Schlemm’s canal, the device is retracted from the eye tearing the microcatheter through the trabecular meshwork for 180 degrees.&#160; The device is then rotated and reinserted and the procedure is repeated for the remaining 180 degrees of the angle to accomplish a full 360 degree treatment.
</p><p><b>Indication </b>

<p><b>Device Design</b>
</p><p>The VISCO360 device (Sight Sciences, Menlo Park, California) allows for catheterization and viscodilation of Schlemm’s canal.&#160; Similar to the TRAB360 device, it is a single-use, single-handed device with a sharp distal tip that is used to pierce the trabecular meshwork and a microcatheter is then advanced through 180 degrees of Schlemm’s canal.&#160; A predetermined amount of viscoelastic fluid is then injected into Schlemm’s canal and the distal collector channels.&#160; The procedure is then repeated for the remaining 180 degree of Schlemm’s canal.&#160; The procedure allows for dilation without tissue destruction of the natural drainage system.&#160; 
</p><p>The OMNI System (Sight Science, Menlo Park, California) is the same hand piece used for VISCO360 and combines the VISCO360 and TRAB360 procedures.&#160; After the surgeon performs viscodilation, the microcatheter is again introduced into Schlemm’s canal and a trabeculotomy is performed to achieve both viscodilation and trabeculotomy in one procedure.&#160; 
</p><p><b>Indication</b>
</p><p>The Visco 360/OMNI System is indicated for the treatment of open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.&#160; It can be performed as a stand-alone procedure or in combination with cataract surgery.&#160; It can be performed in patients who are phakic, pseudophakic or aphakic.&#160;

<p><b>Surgical Approach </b>
</p><p>ABiC is performed using the iTrack microcatheter system (Ellex iScience, Fremont, CA) which is a 250 micron microcatheter with a fiber optic light allowing for visualization of the catheter while in Schlemm’s canal. After making a nasal goniotomy, the catheter is advanced 360 degrees into Schlemm’s canal and slowly withdrawn while performing viscodilation of the canal and the distal outflow system.&#160; This approach allows for enhancement of the natural outflow system without tissue destruction.&#160; Furthermore, it is believed to decrease herniation of the inner wall of Schlemm’s canal into the distal collector channels to improve outflow. 
</p><p><b>Indication </b>
</p><p>ABiC can be performed either in conjunction with cataract extraction or as a stand-alone procedure.&#160; It is indicated for the treatment of mild-moderate glaucoma in addition to more advanced and refractory glaucoma.&#160;

<p><b>Device </b>
</p><p>The CyPass Micro-Stent (Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas) is a polymide, supraciliary device for ab-interno implantation. The goal of the device is to create a controlled cyclodialysis cleft with stented outflow to the suprachoroidal space. The stent is 6.35mm long with an outer diameter of 430 microns, an inner diameter of 300 microns and with 76 micron fenestrations along the length of the device. During surgery, the implant is loaded onto a retractable guidewire and because of the flexibility of the stent, it is able to assume the curvature of the guidewire allowing the stent to conform to the scleral curvature.&#160; The device is inserted through the initial phacoemulsification incision, and advanced toward the sclera spur.  The guide wire is used to perform blunt dissection of the ciliary body in order to allow passage into the supraciliary space where the stent can be placed.&#160; The proximal end of the stent has three retention rings to allow for improved stability of the device in the angle.

</p><p>The <a href="/Xen_Glaucoma_Treatment_System" title="Xen Glaucoma Treatment System">XEN gel stent</a> (Allergan, Dublin, Ireland) is a 6mm device composed of porcine-derived gelatin cross linked with glutaraldehyde.&#160; The inner lumen of the tube is 45 microns in diameter and the outer diameter of the gel stent is 150 microns.&#160; After implantation, the gelatin in the stent hydrates slightly causing expansion of the device to ensure improved stability.&#160; The gel stent is loaded in a single-use, single-handed disposable injector with a 27-gauge needle.&#160; The injector is inserted into the anterior chamber through a clear corneal incision and the tip of the injector is used to pierce through TM and the sclera into the subconjunctival space.&#160; The slider of the injector is advanced to deploy the stent into place and create an outflow from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space.&#160; Mitomycin C is typically injected subconjunctivally before or after stent placement to limit bleb fibrosis.

</p><p><a href="/Cyclodestructive_Procedures_in_Treatment_of_Glaucoma" title="Cyclodestructive Procedures in Treatment of Glaucoma">ECP</a> is performed with an endoscopic probe attached to a laser unit (BVI, Little Silver, NJ) which includes a diode laser (810nm), a Xenon light source, a helium-neon aiming beam, and fiber optic imaging.&#160; The connected video monitor provides for endoscopic viewing by the surgeon and a foot pedal allows for surgeon control of the laser.&#160; The probe comes in a 19, 20, or 23 gauge size that is either straight or curved and is inserted into the anterior chamber through a clear corneal incision.&#160; Laser setting start at 0.2-0.25 Watts, continuous cycle and power is titrated to achieve both blanching and contraction of the ciliary processes.&#160; Treatment typically consists of 200-360 degrees of the angle.&#160; 
</p><p><b>Indications</b>
</p><p>ECP can be used to treat patients with a wide range of glaucoma severity from mild to severe or refractory as well as most glaucoma subtypes.&#160; ECP is most commonly used in open angle glaucoma but also has a particularly advantageous role in the treatment of angle closure or plateau iris where it can function to deepen the angle.&#160; It can be performed in conjunction with phacoemulsification or as a stand-alone procedure in phakic or pseudophakic patients.&#160; ECP can also be performed in conjunction with other angle based procedures above to provide additional IOP lowering.&#160;

<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p>The advent of microinvasive glaucoma surgery has allowed for improved management of patients with mild to moderate glaucoma.&#160; As surgeon experience expands and the number of MIGS approaches grows, these procedures may even be utilized in more severe cases and across a wide range of clinical scenarios.&#160; MIGS procedures are an especially useful treatment option in patients with poor medication tolerance, poor compliance and patients who need more IOP-lowering than drops or laser trabeculoplasty can provide.&#160; MIGS can be easily incorporated into routine phacoemulsification surgery and can be used in patients who are well-controlled on drops but who desire drop independence.&#160; The field of MIGS has expanded rapidly in the last decade adding to the glaucoma surgeons’ armamentarium and their ability to tailor surgical approaches to each specific patient. Future devices and surgical approaches will continue to be developed in the coming years.
